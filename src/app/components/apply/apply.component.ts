Our main aim was to gain a spike in users/customers on our platform. We indeed achieved our goal and more! We were pleasantly surprised at what we achieved in August 2017 and as a result have committed to all 4 shows in 2018. We found the physical presence at TWE not only helped us gain exposure, but also engaging with that amount of people helped give us the assurance that our business is very relevant and got wonderful feedback from the aspiring couples.",
